# Samarth 
> I don't need easy. I just need possible.

Samarth is a project that aims to provide employment opportunities for people with different types of disabilities. Society has had a reflectance towards people with disabilities and has had reservations about them becoming self-sufficient parts of the community; this is what we aim to tackle with our project.

This idea comes from a very personal space for us, as seeing the plight of people with being unable to express themselves in the corporate world is very saddening; there are not a lot of resources for the same.
